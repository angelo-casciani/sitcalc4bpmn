# Temporary Models for Evaluation

This directory contains the IndiGolog process models generated during the evaluation.

## Purpose

When running the evaluation script (`evaluation/src/evaluate.py`), BPMN models from the dataset are automatically translated to Prolog/IndiGolog format and stored here. This keeps evaluation-generated models separate from the main project models.
